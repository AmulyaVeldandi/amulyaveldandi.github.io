  Every deployment starts with a single question: *who is accountable when this model is wrong?*
</Callout>

## 1. Baseline the Workflow

Before any model leaves the notebook, I map the current workflow: decision owners, handoffs, timing, and the incentives at play. Without this baseline, you cannot measure improvement—nor can you spot new failure modes introduced by automation.

- Shadow the workflow for a full shift.
- Capture the artefacts produced today (spreadsheets, sticky notes, dashboards).
- Quantify the cognitive load: how many clicks, reviews, or escalations does the process demand?

## 2. Align Metrics With Harm Scenarios

Clinical AI needs *bidirectional* metrics: the wins we expect (e.g., ↓ turnaround time) and the harms we fear (e.g., ↑ false positives in vulnerable cohorts). For each metric, I document detection methods, thresholds, and the individual empowered to intervene.

## 3. Stress Test Bias and Drift

I rely on stratified evaluation plans. Slice results by modality, scanner, site, demographic, and workflow context. Drift monitors run nightly and alert Slack channels when deviations cross agreed thresholds.

## 4. Close the Loop With Clinicians

Weekly huddles surface agentic insights paired with manual overrides and near-miss reviews. The key is to build psychologically safe spaces where clinicians can say, "this feels wrong" and have the data team investigate without blame.

## 5. Ship Governance Artefacts

Every deployment ships with:

1. An architecture and data lineage diagram.
2. An operating manual with failure playbooks.
3. Contact trees for escalation and rollback.

This is the paperwork that keeps regulators, quality leads, and bedside clinicians aligned.

## 6. Measure Adoption Like a Product Team

We track engagement, perceived usefulness, and outcome deltas through dashboards and quick pulse surveys. Adoption data reveals friction faster than waiting for quarterly reviews.

## 7. Iterate With Humility

Clinical contexts evolve. Models must adapt with them. Treat every deployment as a living service, not a finished product.

  Safe AI feels calm, boring, and accountable. When teams sleep at night, the metrics follow.
