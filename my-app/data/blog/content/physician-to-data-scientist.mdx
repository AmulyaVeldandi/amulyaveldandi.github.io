summary: Lessons from moving bedside empathy into data roles without leaving patients behind.

Switching careers felt like swapping stethoscopes for shell scripts. The throughline? Empathy. Here are the milestones that helped me transition smoothly.

## 1. Translate Clinical Intuition Into Data Questions

I reframed diagnostic reasoning as hypothesis-driven analytics. Every case note became a feature story waiting to be told.

## 2. Build a Portfolio That Speaks Clinician

I built projects that solved clinical pain points: follow-up tracking, imaging QA, triage forecasting. Each showcased outcomes, governance, and the bedside story—not just model accuracy.

## 3. Protect the Empathy Muscle

Weekly shadowing, chart reviews, and mentorship hours keep patients front and centre. Technical excellence matters, but so does the tone of the dashboards and alerts we ship.

## 4. Find Translators and Co-conspirators

Product managers, clinical champions, quality leads—they turned prototypes into programmes. Invest in relationships that help you speak multiple dialects: clinical, technical, operational.

## 5. Document Your Operating System

Over-communicate decisions, write design docs, and capture lessons learned. The faster you make your thinking visible, the faster teams trust you in cross-functional meetings.

The best part? I still practice medicine—just through data, pixels, and pipelines.
