## Highlight Sessions

### Keynote: "Foundation Models in Medical Imaging"

**Speaker**: Prof. Ben Glocker (Imperial College London)

Key takeaways:
- Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale medical imaging datasets show impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities
- Self-supervised learning on diverse imaging data creates versatile representations
- **Critical Challenge**: Ensuring fairness and avoiding bias amplification across different patient populations and imaging protocols
- **Future Direction**: Domain-specific foundation models outperform general-purpose models adapted to medical imaging

**My Reflection**: This aligns with my experience in the Brain MRI U-Net project, where pre-training on diverse datasets significantly improved performance on specific downstream tasks.

### Tutorial: "Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Analysis"

**Instructors**: Dr. Ilja Morison (Stanford) & Dr. Chen Chen (MIT)

**Topics Covered**:
- Contrastive learning frameworks (SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL)
- Masked image modeling for medical images
- View-invariant representations for multi-view imaging
- Practical implementation tips and common pitfalls

**Hands-on Component**:
Implemented contrastive learning on a chest X-ray dataset during the tutorial. The approach yielded features that generalized well to downstream classification tasks with limited labels—directly applicable to my work on radiology report generation.

**Code Shared**:
```python
# Simplified contrastive loss implementation
# Adapted from the tutorial

def contrastive_loss(z_i, z_j, temperature=0.5):
    """
    z_i, z_j: augmented views of the same image
    Returns: NT-Xent loss for self-supervised learning
    """
    # Normalize embeddings
    z_i = F.normalize(z_i, dim=1)
    z_j = F.normalize(z_j, dim=1)

    # Compute similarity matrix
    representations = torch.cat([z_i, z_j], dim=0)
    similarity_matrix = F.cosine_similarity(
        representations.unsqueeze(1),
        representations.unsqueeze(0),
        dim=2
    )

    # Apply temperature scaling and compute loss
    ...
```
