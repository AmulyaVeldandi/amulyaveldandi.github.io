## Summit Overview

The AMIA Informatics Summit 2025 in San Francisco brought together clinical informaticists, data scientists, healthcare administrators, and technology leaders to address critical challenges in health informatics. As healthcare systems increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, this summit focused on practical solutions for EHR optimization, interoperability, AI integration, and clinical decision support.

## Summit Themes

### Core Focus Areas

1. **Clinical Decision Support Systems**: Next-generation CDSS leveraging AI and real-time data
2. **EHR Optimization**: Reducing clinician burden and improving usability
3. **Interoperability**: FHIR standards and seamless data exchange
4. **AI Integration**: Embedding machine learning into clinical workflows
5. **Patient Engagement**: Digital tools empowering patients in their care
6. **Data Governance**: Privacy, security, and ethical use of health data

## Keynote Highlights

### "The Future of Clinical Informatics: From Data to Wisdom"

**Speaker**: Dr. Judith Faulkner (Founder & CEO, Epic Systems)

**Key Messages**:
- **Data Deluge**: Healthcare generates massive data, but struggles to extract actionable insights
- **Interoperability Progress**: FHIR adoption accelerating, but implementation challenges remain
- **AI Integration**: Predictive models must be seamlessly embedded in clinical workflows
- **Clinician Well-being**: Technology should reduce burden, not add to it
- **Patient Partnership**: Patients are co-pilots, not passive recipients of care

**Quote That Resonated**: *"We've won the battle for digitization. Now we must win the war for usability and intelligence."*

**My Reflection**: This aligns with my experience in the CT Throughput Optimizer and Radiology Report Summarization projects—technical solutions must fit naturally into existing workflows to be adopted.

### Panel: "AI in Clinical Practice: Beyond the Hype"

**Panelists**:
- Dr. Eric Topol (Scripps Research)
- Dr. Suchi Saria (Johns Hopkins)
- Dr. Nigam Shah (Stanford)
- Dr. Regina Barzilay (MIT)

**Discussion Points**:

**Transparency & Trust**:
- Clinicians need to understand *why* models make predictions
- Black-box models create liability concerns
- Explainability is not optional—it's essential for clinical adoption

**Data Quality & Bias**:
- "Garbage in, garbage out" applies even more in healthcare
- Models trained on biased data perpetuate health disparities
- Continuous monitoring for drift and fairness is critical

**Integration Challenges**:
- EHR vendors slow to integrate third-party AI models
- Workflow interruption is the #1 reason clinicians abandon tools
- Alert fatigue from poorly designed CDSS

**Regulatory Landscape**:
- FDA evolving approach to AI/ML medical devices
- Reimbursement models don't yet value AI-assisted care
- Liability questions remain unresolved

**My Takeaway**: Success requires addressing technical, regulatory, and workflow challenges simultaneously. My AuDRA-Rad project aims to tackle these holistically.

## Sessions Attended

### Track: Clinical Decision Support

#### "Intelligent Alerts: Reducing Fatigue While Improving Safety"

**Presenters**: Mayo Clinic Informatics Team

**Problem**: Alert overload leads to clinician burnout and dangerous "alert fatigue"—ignoring critical warnings

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Machine Learning for Alert Prioritization**: Predict which alerts clinicians will actually act on
2. **Contextual Delivery**: Show alerts only when relevant to current task
3. **Smart Suppression**: Temporarily hide low-priority alerts during critical activities
4. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust based on patient risk and clinician specialty

**Results**:
- 40% reduction in total alerts
- 75% increase in alert acceptance rate
- 92% clinician satisfaction improvement
- No increase in adverse events

**Relevance to My Work**: Directly applicable to AuDRA-Rad—ensuring recommendations are timely, relevant, and actionable.

#### "Real-Time Clinical Guidelines at the Point of Care"

**Author**: Dr. David Bates (Brigham & Women's Hospital)

**Innovation**: FHIR-based guideline retrieval integrated with EHR

**How It Works**:
1. Monitor patient context in real-time
2. Retrieve relevant clinical guidelines
3. Present summarized recommendations in workflow
4. Allow easy documentation of adherence or deviation

**Clinical Impact**:
- Improved guideline adherence from 42% to 78%
- Reduced unnecessary variations in care
- Better documentation of clinical reasoning
- Positive impact on quality metrics

**Connection to AuDRA-Rad**: My autonomous radiology assistant implements similar concepts—retrieving ACR/Fleischner guidelines and generating actionable recommendations.

### Track: Interoperability & Data Exchange

#### "FHIR in Production: Lessons from Large-Scale Implementations"

**Panel with Representatives from**:
- Kaiser Permanente
- Cleveland Clinic
- Partners HealthCare
- Veterans Health Administration

**Common Challenges**:
1. **Resource Mapping**: Translating proprietary EHR data to FHIR resources
2. **Version Management**: Handling updates to FHIR specifications
3. **Performance**: Optimizing queries for large patient populations
4. **Security**: Ensuring OAuth 2.0 and other auth mechanisms work correctly
5. **Buy-in**: Getting clinical and IT stakeholders aligned

**Success Factors**:
- Start small with specific use cases
- Invest in robust testing infrastructure
- Prioritize clinician feedback
- Build internal FHIR expertise
- Plan for long-term maintenance

**My Learning**: Interoperability is hard. Standards help, but implementation details matter enormously. This informs my thinking about how AuDRA-Rad integrates with hospital systems.

### Track: AI & Machine Learning

#### "Federated Learning for Multi-Site Clinical Research"

**Speakers**: Collaboration between Stanford, Duke, and UCSF

**Use Case**: Training sepsis prediction models across institutions without sharing patient data

**Technical Approach**:
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to protect individual patients
- **Secure Aggregation**: Hospitals never see each other's data
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Compute on encrypted data
- **Model Averaging**: Combine local models into global model

**Results**:
- Federated model outperformed single-site models
- Privacy guarantees maintained throughout
- Enabled research on 500,000+ patients across sites
- Deployable at each participating institution

**Relevance**: Could enable my Pancreas SQ-MRI CDSS to learn from multiple institutions while preserving patient privacy.

## Workshops Attended
